## Lecture outline

What does the term "data science" mean to you?

So we have three terms here:
- Statistics
- Machine learning (ML)
- Data science
How are they different from each other? For example, what is the difference between a "statistical model" and a "machine learning model?" Or maybe they are the same thing? Just fancy words to be created to confuse people?

What is "learning" as in machine learning?

What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? (Q1 in Quiz #1)

### Some basics 

Random variable: A **value** that follows a probability distribution. Are the following quantities random variables?
- The number of apples in a basket
- Your height
- The height of a person sitting here who I randomly pick up
- Today’s temperature
- The number I get by rolling a die

What is a probability density function (PDF)?

Now let's revisit expectation, variance, and their mathematical expressions (Q2 in Quiz #1)

<!-- Do you think an inflated die is fair? How to test it?

Histogram and statistical distributions -->

<!-- List at least one random variable in environmental science and remote sensing that fit each statistical distribution:
- Gaussian distribution (aka normal distribution)
- Gamma distribution
- Beta distribution
- Binomial distribution -->

<!-- Central limit theorem -->

<!-- Suppose Yushan measures 3952.43 m by a satellite altimeter. And the maximum measurement error of this altimeter is 0.2 m according to its documentation. What is the uncertainty of Yushan’s height? What is the 95% confidence interval of Yushan’s height? -->

### Data skills

Here are things we don't primarily focus on during the class but are essential for building up your data skills for reproducible science.

- Programming
- Collaboration and version control (Git & GitHub) (Check out Q4 in Quiz #1)
- Jupyter (incl. Google Colab)
- Data import and wrangling
- Visualization

## Group discussion & demo topics

1. Can you implement Q3 in Quiz #1 and show me the histogram?
2. Get the data necessary for doing Exercise 4.2 in Hsieh's book.
