## Lecture outline

### Intro

What does the term "data science" mean to you?

So we have two terms here:
- Statistics
- Machine learning (ML)
<!-- - Data science -->
How are they different from each other? For example, what is the difference between a "statistical model" and a "machine learning model?" Or maybe they are the same thing? Just fancy words to be created to confuse people?

<!-- What is "learning" as in machine learning? -->

What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

Checking in your answers for Q4 in the Pre-course Quiz.

### Data skills

Here are things we don't primarily focus on during the class but are essential for building up your data skills for reproducible science.

- Programming
- Collaboration and version control (Git & GitHub)
- Jupyter (incl. Google Colab)
- Data import and wrangling
- Visualization

### Basics of statistics 

Random variable: A **value** that follows a probability distribution. Are the following quantities random variables?
- The number of apples in a basket
- Your height
- The height of a person sitting here who I randomly pick up
<!-- - Todayâ€™s temperature -->
<!-- - The number I get by rolling a die -->

<!-- What is a probability density function (PDF)? How is it different from a probability distribution? -->

Now let's revisit expectation, variance, and their mathematical expressions (cont. Q1 in Pre-course Quiz): 

<!-- Derive the expectation and the variance of the Bernoulli distribution $Ber(x|p) = p^x(1-p)^{1-x}$. -->

### More about probability distributions

- Gaussian: many distributions converge to this thanks to the central limit theory
  - How does this relate to Q2 in the Pre-course Quiz?
<!-- - Poisson distribution -->
- Student t-distribution: Bounded to the mean
<!-- - Chi-squared ($\chi^2$) distribution: Bounded to the square of the Gaussians -->
- Beta and Gamma distributions: different supports for different kinds of environment variables

## Group discussion & Demos

1. Discuss how you would reproduce the figure for Q3 in the Pre-course Quiz.
2. Get the data necessary for doing Exercise 4.5 in Hsieh's book.
