# RS5046/GP5024: Environmental data science (環境資料科學)

Welcome to *RS5046/GP5024: Environmental data science*! 

Data science is an ancient yet novel subject that originated from centuries of exploration in statistics. In the past two decades, significant advances have been made due to the rapid growth in data volume and computing speed. Many promising new concepts and models have emerged. This course aims to deepen your understanding of the data science concepts and techniques commonly used in environmental science. Through reading and hands-on projects, you will delve into cutting-edge statistical models in environmental science and learn how to use these models to decompose the ways the Earth‘s system runs. Have fun!
