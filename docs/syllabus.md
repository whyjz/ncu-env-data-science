# Syllabus 

**RS5046/GP5024: Environmental data science (環境資料科學)** Spring 2024

Whyjay Zheng (鄭懷傑), whyjz@csrsr.ncu.edu.tw, Tuesday 10:00 am -- 12:30 pm at R2-203 

Office hours by appointment are in my office (R3-230).

## Course goals

- Familiar yourself with the language data scientists use to communicate. 
- Understand some of the most popular statistical models in environmental science.
- Develop skills to process real data for insights.
- Collaborate with your teammates for a big data science project.

## Prerequisites 

Before taking this course, you should already have the necessary knowledge about statistics and computer programming. Check out [this web page](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/supervised_learning.html) and see if you can understand most of the ideas and steps presented here within a reasonable reading time. 

If more than two questions in Quiz #1 are challenging, I suggest you take introductory statistics/programming first.

## Course components

### Readings
The assigned readings are sections from Hsieh's book (see course calendar for the section numbers). We will have you discuss your reflection on the content during the class discussion (and maybe with some quizzes).

### During the class
You will see three segments during the class time:

1. Group discussion (10:00--10:30): Please find solutions or perspectives to my questions on a worksheet as a group. These questions are typically related to the assigned readings or the homework.
2. Lecture (10:30--11:50): I (Whyjay) will review today's topics.
3. Hands-on session or the second group discussion (11:50--): We will demo some workflows and data processing skills (for your homework and term project) and have you work on that with the help of classmates and me.

Non-graded quizzes (if any) are typically distributed at the beginning of the lecture. We will let you work on that for 5--10 minutes.

### Homework assignments
There will be five problem sets throughout the semester. You must work on them individually (i.e., no collaboration and plagiarism). Assignments are due before class starts (see course calendar for due dates). Electronic submission through ee-class is recommended, but other forms are also acceptable. Please make sure I get your submission before the deadline to avoid a potential late penalty if you don't use ee-class.

### Term project
Your group term project consists of three milestones: (1) Half to one-page long project proposal as a group, due April 9 before the class starts. (2) Oral presentations as a group on June 4; details TBD. (3) An online webpage showcasing your project work, published no later than June 11.

## Grading
I will evaluate your submissions and post your grades using Ee-class. The grade breakdown is as follows:

- Readings and class discussion (20％): Each group worksheet accounts for 2% of the grade. I grade it using a simple rubric system: Good (2%), Fair (1%), and Absent (0%). All group members receive the same grade. This semester, we will have twelve worksheets, and the two lowest-graded worksheets will be dropped for final grade calculation.

- Assignments (50％): Each problem set accounts for 12.5% of the grade. The lowest-graded one will be dropped for final grade calculation. Most of the problems are from Hsieh's book, in which the suggested solution is provided. But remember: **The doing is often more important than the outcome.** The grades of your assignments are heavily based on the reproducibility of your workflow (8.75%) rather than the correctness of your results (3.75%). Please include scripts, screenshots, or other elements that can make other people reproduce your work. 

- Term project (30％): Project proposal accounts for 5%. I will typically give you full credits for this unless it does not fulfill format requirements. Oral presentation accounts for 15%, and the final webpage accounts for 10%. These are graded based on the quality/completeness of the work, clarity of the presentation, and the ease of other people's reuse of your workflow or results. All team members receive the same base grade above, plus individual grade adjustments based on a confidential poll from the teammates. 

(late-work-policy)=
### Late work policy
- Write-ups: A 10% penalty will be applied for each day past the deadline. 
- Term project presentation: If you are absent on the oral presentation date, we accept video recordings to be shared within the class as a make-up. However, a 20% penalty will be applied for each day past the presentation date. 
- With reasonable proof, the policies above may be exempted under particular circumstances, such as family emergencies or urgent medical conditions. Please let me know (Whyjay) as soon as possible if this happens so we can discuss make-up plans as needed.


## Code of conduct

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)

- We will not tolerate any forms of discrimination and harassment during the class. 

- We encourage conversations about inequality whenever you sense that. This includes but is not limited to [hidden curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_curriculum) and [microaggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression). 

- Be respectful about different ideas and perspectives during discussion, and be mindful about your choice of words. 

### Attribution of work

- Please be careful about using copyrighted material in any assignments, and make sure you have permission/license with proper attribution whenever you use it.

- Again, do not work with other students on the homework assignments. They must be your sole work.

### AI policy
Generative AI is allowed and encouraged (HEY... this is the power of data science!!). Use it with discretion, though -- generative AI is good at popular tasks (such as giving a code for visualizing a typical data structure) but not so good at giving ideas and perspectives. Their answers are usually very dull (if not failing a sanity check) due to the nature of the training process.

### Working languages
We use English as the primary language to communicate during the class and the oral presentation. Some exceptions are:

- You can use a different language in group discussion if everyone agrees. 

- Students taking RS5046 must use English for writing individual assignments, and students taking GP5024 can choose between English and 中文.

You are welcome to complete assignments using any programming language. I am familiar with Python and Matlab and can comment more if you use either. We will use Python with the Jupyter ecosystem (including Colab) for the class demos.
